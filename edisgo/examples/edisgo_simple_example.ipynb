    "eDisGo is a **python toolbox for the analysis of distribution networks** (low and medium voltage) that can be used to investigate economically viable **network expansion** scenarios, considering alternative flexibility options such as **storages or redispatch**. \n",
    "\n",
    "eDisGo is developed in the [open_eGo research project](https://openegoproject.wordpress.com/). It is based on [PyPSA](https://pypsa.org/), a toolbox for simulation and optimization of power networks, and closely related to the [ding0](https://dingo.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) project. ding0 stands for distribution network generator and is a tool to generate synthetic status quo medium and low voltage power distribution networks based on open (or at least accessible) data. It is currently the single data source for eDisGo providing synthetic grid data for whole Germany.\n",
