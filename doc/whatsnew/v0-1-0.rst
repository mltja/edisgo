Release v0.1.0
================

Release date: July 26, 2021

This release comes with some major refactoring. The internal data structure
of the network topologies was changed from a networkx graph structure to
a pandas dataframe structure based on the
`PyPSA <https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ data structure. This comes
along with major API changes.
Not all functionality of the previous eDisGo release 0.0.10 is yet refactored
(e.g. the heuristics for grid supportive storage integration and generator
curtailment), but we are working on it and the upcoming releases will
have the full functionality again.

Besides the refactoring we added extensive tests along with automatic testing
with GitHub Actions and coveralls tool to track test coverage.

Further, from now on python 3.6 is not supported anymore. Supported python
versions are 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9.

Changes
-------

* Major refactoring `#159 <https://github.com/openego/eDisGo/pull/159>`_
* Added support for Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 `#181 <https://github.com/openego/eDisGo/pull/181>`_

* Adapted to new ding0 release `#184 <https://github.com/openego/eDisGo/pull/184>`_ - loads and generators in the same building are now connected to the same bus instead of separate buses and loads and generators in aggregated load areas are connected via a MV/LV station instead of directly to the HV/MV station)
* Added charging points as new components along with a methodology to integrate them into the grid
* Added multiperiod optimal power flow based on julia package PowerModels.jl optimizing storage positioning and/or operation as well as generator dispatch with regard to minimizing grid expansion costs
