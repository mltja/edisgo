Release v0.0.3
==============

Release date: July 6 2018

New features have been included in this release. Major changes being the use of the weather_cell_id and
the inclusion of new methods for distributing the curtailment to be more suitable to network operations.

Changes
-------

* As part of the solution to github issues `#86 <https://github.com/openego/eDisGo/issues/86>`_,
  `#98 <https://github.com/openego/eDisGo/issues/98>`_, Weather cell information was of importance due to the changes
  in the source of data. The table  `ego_renewable_feedin_v031` is now used to provide this feedin time series indexed
  using the weather cell id's. Changes were made to ego.io and ding0 to correspondingly allow the use of this table
  by eDisGo.

* A new curtailment method have been included based on the voltages at the nodes with `GeneratorFluctuating` objects.
  The method is called `curtail_voltage` and its objective is to increase curtailment at locations where voltages
  are very high, thereby alleviating over-voltage issues and also reducing the need for network reinforcement.

* Add parallelization for custon functions
  `#130 <https://github.com/openego/eDisGo/issues/130>`_

* Update `ding0 version to v0.1.6 <https://github.com/openego/ding0/releases/tag/v0.1.6>`_ and include
  `data processing v.4.2 data <https://github.com/openego/data_processing/releases/tag/v0.4.2>`_

* Bug Fixes
