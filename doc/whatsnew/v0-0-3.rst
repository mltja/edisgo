Release v0.0.3
==============

Release date: May 24 2018

New features have been included in this release. Major changes being the use of the weather_cell_id and
the inclusion of new methods for distributing the curtailment to be more suitable to network operations.

Changes
-------

* Weather cell information was of importance due to the change in the source of data available from oedb.
  The table  `ego_renewable_feedin` is now used to provide this feedin time series indexed using the weather cells.
  Changes were made to ego.io and ding0 to correspondingly allow the use of this table by eDisGo.

* A new curtailment method have been included based on the voltages at the nodes with `GeneratorFluctuating` objects.
  The method is called `curtail_voltage` and its objective is to increase curtailment at locations where voltages
  are very high, thereby alleviating over-voltage issues and also reducing the need for network reinforcement.
